## üìÑ Project Overview

This project, developed collaboratively with classmates, provided practical experience in system analysis and design. 

### Introduction

- Many English centers struggle with manual or inefficient management processes, hindering their growth and performance. 
- This application addresses these challenges with a user-friendly interface and robust features, improving efficiency and streamlining operations.

### Research Problems

Traditional management methods often lack remote collaboration, pose security risks, and are not automation-friendly. Data management becomes increasingly difficult as English centers grow, leading to disorganization and communication issues.  This application provides a solution with automation, a user-friendly UI, and diverse functionality.

### Objectives

- Faster database searches.
- Improved online communication between teachers and students.
- Key features include:
    - Enrollment and placement test management.
    - Student/Teacher management.
    - User management.
    - Academic and classroom management.
    - Academic results and financial management.
    - Analysis/reporting.
    - Data recovery and backup.

### Scope and Limitations

Due to time and resource constraints, the project focuses on:
- User role assignment.
- Class and lesson management.
- User management.
- Course and chapter management.
- Schedule generation.
- Attendance tracking.
